# CarbonEstimator
## Author: Brad Hubbard-Nelson - 1 May 2019

Besides being a sandbox for me to get familiar with the technology of Django, this
project is an online Carbon Estimator for events, based on the Cooler Concord Carbon
points estimator.  It uses a Google Sheets spreadsheet file to define the actions and
questions, and enters data into the spreadsheet to calculate carbon points and dollar
savings.  A PDF example of the spreadsheet first page is in the Documentation folder.
Please contact me if you would like access to a live spreadsheet or need help with 
credentials for gaining access to the spreadsheets API
